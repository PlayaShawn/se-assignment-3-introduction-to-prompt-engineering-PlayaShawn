Types of Prompts:

Describe different types of prompts (e.g., open-ended prompts, instructional prompts). How does the type of prompt influence the AI model's response?
      
     1. Open-Ended Prompts
          These prompts do not restrict the response format and content allowing the AI model to generate creative and varied outputs.

     2. Instructional Prompts
         Provides clear directions or tasks to be followed by the AI model and the type of information to be provided.


     3. Conditional Prompts
         Have specific conditions or contexts that modify the prompt. They provide additional constraints to the model for generating the response.


     4. Multiple-Choice Prompts
         These prompts have a set of options or choices for the AI  and they constrain it to the predefined choices/answers.

     Impact on Response: 
         -Multiple-choice prompts restrict the AI's output to predefined options thus simplifying decision-making and enhancing accuracy when selecting from specific options.
         -Conditional prompts tailor the AI's response based on the provided conditions or context. They enable the AI to adapt its output dynamically,
         -Instructional prompts guide the AI to produce specific outputs aligned with the task instructions. T
         -Open-ended prompts allow the AI to explore a wide range of information and generate responses that may include various aspects, examples, and interpretations.

Prompt Tuning:

What is prompt tuning, and how does it differ from traditional fine-tuning methods? Provide a scenario where prompt tuning would be advantageous.

     Prompt tuning is a technique for optimizing inputs or prompts given to a large language model (LLM) to effectively influence its outputs and involves refining and iterating on the formulation of prompts.

     Differnces between Prompt Tuning and Traditional Fine-Tuning:
         Prompt Tuning adjusts the prompts provided to the LLM to refine how queries or instructions are framed to elicit specific types of responses while traditional Fine-Tuning involves modifying the internal parameters (e.g., weights, architecture) of the model during training.
     
         Prompt Tuning requires iterative testing and refinement of different prompt formulations while traditional fine-tuning  involves a more structured process of data preparation, training, and evaluation on task-specific datasets.


     Scenario: Improving Customer Support Responses Using a Chatbot where a company wants to deploy a chatbot powered by a large language model to handle customer support inquiries.

             -It can improve the accuracy and relevance of the chatbot's responses by refining prompts based on historical customer interactions and common inquiries
             -It enables the chatbot to adapt and generate appropriate responses without requiring re-training or extensive adjustments to the it's parameters.
             It facilitates efficient deployment and updates to the chatbot's capabilities compared to traditional fine-tuning methods.

Role of Context in Prompts:

Explain the role of context in designing effective prompts. How can adding or omitting context affect the output of an AI model?

     Role of Context in Designing Effective Prompts:
         -It clarifies the intent and scope which helps in aligning the model's output with the user's expectations/intended use case.
         -By setting expectations,context helps customize the response to the expected level of detail.
         -Context can provide background information ensuring the AI's response is relevant and up-to-date.


     Impact of Adding or Omitting Context on AI Model Outputs:
         Accuracy and Relevance: Adding context helps the AI model better understand the specific requirements leading to more accurate and relevant responses.
         Focus and Scope: Contextual prompts guide the AI in narrowing down the scope of information it should consider.
         Bias and Interpretation: Context can mitigate biases by providing a balanced directive for reference by the AI in intepreting the prompt hence ensuring the responses are contextual and unbiased.
         User Satisfaction: prompts with appropriate context enhance user satisfaction.

Ethical Considerations in Prompt Engineering:

What ethical issues should be considered when designing prompts for AI systems? Discuss potential biases and how they can be mitigated.
